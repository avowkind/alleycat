# Key Concepts in Stoic Philosophy

Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophical school founded by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE. It later became one of the most influential philosophies in Rome. Here are five fundamental concepts in Stoic philosophy:

## 1. Virtue (AretÃª)

* The highest good and the only true good in Stoic philosophy
* Consists of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance
* Living in accordance with virtue means living a life of excellence according to reason
* Virtue is sufficient for happiness (eudaimonia)

## 2. Dichotomy of Control

* Distinguishing between what is within our control and what is not
* We control our judgments, desires, aversions, and intentions
* We do not control external events, other people's actions, reputation, wealth, etc.
* Focus energy only on things within our control, accept with equanimity things outside our control

## 3. Negative Visualization (Premeditatio Malorum)

* The practice of contemplating potential hardships and loss
* Helps build resilience against future adversity
* Increases gratitude for what you currently have
* Reduces anxiety by mentally preparing for difficulties

## 4. Living According to Nature (Secundum Naturam)

* Acting in harmony with cosmic order and rational nature
* Understanding our role in the broader universe
* Accepting natural processes without resistance
* Recognizing our connection to all humanity as rational beings
* Embracing our social nature and duties to community

## 5. The Discipline of Assent

* Carefully examining impressions before accepting them
* Not automatically accepting judgments about external events
* Questioning initial reactions and emotional responses
* Choosing rational responses rather than automatic ones
* Training the mind to avoid hasty judgments and emotional reactivity
